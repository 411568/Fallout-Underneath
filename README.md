<h2>🧐 What is it?<h2>

![Game screen](/Images/screen1.png)

Fallout Underneath is a console game created for an university C# course. 
The player (<span style="color:green">■</span>) is tasked with escaping from a tunnel deep in the fallout wasteland.
We can move using the WASD buttons. At the start of the game, we are equiped with a pickaxe. It allows us to destroy the walls (<span style="color:gray">█</span>).

On our way, the pickaxe can break down. Fortunately, we can find a new one, as well as other mystery items!

Beware though, there are also ghouls waiting to attack anything that moves. 

To check your current equipment and use items, you can press the button "i". 
Rembember, that there is a weight limit, that changes each level.

To advance to the next level, you have to reach the door at the corner of the map (<span style="color:blue">█</span>)
